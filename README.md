Game Development week 1 game idea


      I want to make a RTS game. It supports two players fight each other. 
      The player need to choose a camp from sphere, triangular pyramid and cube. 
      They have different special attributes: sphere has faster movement speed 
      but low attract, triangular pyramid has higher attract but low health and 
      cube has have higher defense but low movement speed. Each small spherical, 
      three pyramid, cube is the basic unit: soldier. Soldiers need to be recruited 
      through barracks. Soldiers need to go to different buildings to get different 
      weapons to arm themselves, such as swordsmen, archers, lancers, shields. They 
      can also get horses or chariots at stables. Soldiers who do not carry weapons 
      can collect resources. For simplicity, there are only three resources: food, 
      wood and iron. Different buildings and units need to consume different amounts 
      of resources. The game wins by conquering the enemy's base. At the same time, 
      there will be more details in the later production process.
